# Add & remove users

Infra acts as it's own identity source, allowing you to manually add & remove users without an existing identity source such as Okta.

## Addding a user

```
infra users create <email> <password>
```

## Removing a user

```
infra users delete <email>
```

## Listing users

```
infra users ls
```
