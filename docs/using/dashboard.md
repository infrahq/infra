# The Infra Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is the main UI in Infra, providing easy access to everything an administrator needs to do with **Infra**. It is split into several main sections, accessible with the menu on the left, or if the window is narrow enough, when you click the three line icon, also known as a hamburger icon.
