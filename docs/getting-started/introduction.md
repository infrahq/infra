# Introduction

## Why Infra?

Infra enables you to discover and access infrastructure (e.g. Kubernetes, databases). We help you connect an identity provider such as Okta or Azure active directory, and map users/groups with the permissions you set to your infrastructure.

If you don't have an identity provider, Infra supports local users for you to get started before connecting an identity provider.

### Features

* Easy-to-use CLI: **discover & login** to infrastructure in one command
* **No more out-of-sync** credentials or configurations (e.g. Kubeconfig)
* **Onboard and offboard users & groups** via existing identity providers (e.g. Okta, Google)
* Integrate with native **RBAC** authorization systems (e.g. Kubernetes roles)
* Workflow for **dynamically requesting & granting access** to users (coming soon)
* **Audit logs** for who accessed what, when (coming soon)

### Example (Kubernetes)

```bash
# Log in as henry@acme.com via Okta
$ infra login infra.acme.dev
  ... logging in with Okta
  ... logged in as henry@acme.com

# Discover what you can access via `infra list`
# In the example below, 3 Kubernetes clusters are connected to Infra. 
# Infra has already synchronized the kubeconfig file so the 
# user can use their tool of choice right away (i.e. kubectl)

$ infra list
  RESOURCE                           ACCESS
  kubernetes.production              view
  kubernetes.production.web          edit
  kubernetes.staging                 edit
  kubernetes.development             edit

# You can switch clusters using your existing tools
# Infra also includes a CLI command for switching clusters
$ infra use production.web
Switched to context "production.web".

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
web-d6797786d-cz5jh   1/1     Running   0          8h
web-d6797786d-wzxns   1/1     Running   0          8h
web-d6797786d-zjbvl   1/1     Running   0          8h
```

### Deploy anywhere

Infra works anywhere and doesn't depend on any existing identity & access management system such as AWS IAM, Google IAM or Azure AD. It can be completely self-hosted, including behind existing VPNs or proxies.

### Automatic onboarding & offboarding

No more manual wiki pages, onboarding tickets or slowing down while access is manually granted. With Infra users can be provisioned access automatically when they join the team.

### Connectors for your favorite tools & services

Infra includes a growing set of rich connectors for popular infrastructure tools:

* [Kubernetes](../connectors/kubernetes.md)
* Databases (coming soon)
* SSH (coming soon)
* Kafka (coming soon)

### No more long-lived, shared admin passwords or credentials

Credentials generated by Infra are:
1. Unique to every user
2. Scoped based on what the user needs to access (e.g. read-only, editor, admin)
3. Rotated automatically

### An extensible API

Infra includes a **REST API** so you can customize how easy it is for your team to get access. Example use cases we've seen include:

* Just-in-time access (adding & removing access on the fly)
* Custom CLI tools to access infrastructure (e.g. custom-built `acmectl` internal CLI)
* Co-ordinating access with on-call rotation
* A Slack bot to request or manage access

### Secure by default

Data stored and transmitted by Infra is always encrypted. Read more about our [security](../reference/security.md).
