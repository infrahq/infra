[Infra](https://infrahq.com) provides authentication and access management to servers, clusters, and databases.

## Getting Started

See the [quickstart guide](./docs/quickstart.md)

## Documentation

For documentation, see the [docs](./docs)

## Next steps

Congratulations. You've successfully connected your first cluster.

Infra works best when used with a team. Next, configure how users authenticate by connecting an [identity provider](https://infrahq.com/docs/manage/authentication#identity-providers), or add users directly by [inviting them](https://infrahq.com/docs/manage/users-groups#adding-a-user).
